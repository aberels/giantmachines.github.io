                Since launching in 2005,  Flight Club’s software systems have
                developed by accretion and the sheer momentum of its business.
                Point of sale (PoS), order management, ecommerce and more had
                been layered on top of a FileMaker core using a tangle of vendors
                and services. With sales exploding and new product offerings in
                the works, it was clear that the systems that served the company
                so well during the first 10 years of growth would not support
                the next 10.

                  <p>
                    Rebuilding Flight Club’s business software is a great deal like
                    rebuilding a bridge without stopping the flow of traffic. The
                    “legacy” system in place is mostly working and it should be
                    unaffected by new construction. Giant Machines ultimately delivered
                    a new system able to work in tandem with Flight Club’s legacy
                    software allowing for an incremental phasing in of new
                    functionality as old functionality is replaced. This strategy
                    allows for the business to continue to operate while being able to
                    take advantage of efficiencies of the new system the moment they
                    are available.

                    offerings both in-house and by external vendors. The data
                    migration to a relational database has unlocked a treasure trove
                    of historical pricing information providing Flight Club and its

                Minted is a design marketplace. They have a unique competitive
                advantage where they source creative content from a global
                community of independent artists, then sell the best content
                in the form of art, home décor, and stationery, directly to
                consumers. An early pioneer of crowdsourcing, Minted has held
                art and design challenges monthly since April 2008.

                    Minted, like all websites, was starting to see a larger
                    and larger share of their site traffic coming from
                    smartphones.  Without a mobile optimized site, mobile users
                    were not converting as frequently as desktop users and
                    Minted was losing out on revenue opportunities.

                    Minted engaged Giant Machines to integrate with the Minted
                    team to build out their mobile vision, with a focus on the
                    browsing experience, customizing art products, and the
                    checkout flow.

                    Starting with Minted’s Visual Design concepts, our team was
                    able to build a solid mobile experience in the months
                    preceding their main holiday season, fast tracking a major
                    priority on the roadmap.  Our team also worked closely
                    with Minted’s QA team to ensure a successful launch.  We
                    were able to test our implementations across a variety of
                    different devices, hitting over 95% device coverage based
                    on their traffic demographics.

                  <p>
                    Minted now has a great mobile experience, with easy access
                    to an updated navigation system, cart, checkout, as well
                    as registration, sign up, order status and other essential
                    endpoints.  The new system extended the existing desktop
                    logic, which allowed for the best tradeoff between
                    maintainability and extensibility of new features.
