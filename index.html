          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            AirDye approached us with one of the biggest technical challenges
            we had ever seen: migrate the company's entire business and
            manufacturing systems from a collection of aging, unsupported
            platforms onto a modern web-enabled infrastructure, make
            thousands of design assets browsable by customers and salespeople,
            and finally take its proprietary color matching technologies from
            the desktop to the cloud. The client wanted to completely
            transform the global textile printing business with a networked
            global supply chain and web-based coloration, previewing, and
            ordering. This would represent a radical departure from business
            as usual in textile printing where the majority of business is
            done with phone calls, emails, and the shipping of physical samples.

          <p>
            At the time of engagement, AirDye's manufacturing and ERP systems
            were running Paradox, a file-based database installed at the
            company in the 1990s. Their design assets were hosted on a NAS in
            North Carolina, stored in a proprietary third-party format called
            AVA.  Its proprietary color matching and printing software was
            running on Windows desktop computers. To fulfill the vision, we
            would need to develop methods for data extraction from their
            legacy systems, integrate with a modern ERP, and wrap core
            functions of the desktop software and deploy to the cloud.

          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>
            To unlock access to the business data stored in Paradox, we
            collaborated with the engineering team at AirDye to leverage
            existing synchronization processes that read data from Paradox
            and write it to a MSSQL 2000 database. We took this on-site
            process and moved it to Azure, Microsoft's cloud platform. We
            chose Microsoft's Azure platform to deploy the majority of the
            core manufacturing and technical infrastructure of AirDye based
            on the Windows-centric software that ran the company.

            With the company's business data now available outside of the
            manufacturing location, we then authored an HTTP API using
            Microsoft's Entity Framework and Web API technologies to allow for
            data access from nearly any language. With an HTTP API now
            exposing the data, we wrote processes to fully populate a
            cloud-hosted MySQL database that would later be used to build the
            customer and sales portals and integrate them with a new ERP.

            Design files were copied from the on-site NAS to Azure Blob

            portals, ERP, color management software, and manufacturing processes.

            We then began the task of extracting the algorithms from their
            proprietary color management desktop software for use in online
            color-accurate design previews - a first in the textile printing
            industry. The C++ code underlying the software was very well
            factored - the product of 15 years of engineering - but needed
            work to make it available as a Web Service. Rather than rewriting
            this valuable code, Giant Machines authored C# wrappers to expose
            the needed C++ functions. These wrappers now form the foundation
            of not only the Web Services, but also of the next generation of
            development for this specialized manufacturing software that will
            link these services directly to the printers.

            NetSuite was chosen by the client as an ERP to manage their
            customers, orders, inventory, and aspects of the manufacturing
            process. Giant Machines collaborated with a NetSuite vendor to
            integrate this new ERP implementation with the new customer and
            sales portals providing a seamless flow of data from web through
            to back office and manufacturing.

            The systems developed by Giant Machines were the background for
            the tremendous business moves the company made in 2014 and 2015
            including a merger with its largest customer and the expansion of
            its manufacturing globally. The development process is ongoing and
            we look forward to continuing to provide exceptional value to
            AirDye's new market presence, IMBU, in 2016.
